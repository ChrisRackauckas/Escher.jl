<!--
The restriction value specifies the area that the action will be confined to. The value can be:

a rect object with top, left, bottom and right or x, y, width and height,
an element whose dimensions will be used as the restriction area,
a function which takes (x, y, element) and returns a rect or an element
one of these strings:
'self' – restrict to the target element’s rect
'parent' – restrict to the rect of the element’s parentNode or
a CSS selector string – if one of the parents of the target element matches this selector, it’s rect will be used as the restriction area.


For the left and right properties, 0 means the left edge of the element and 1 means the right edge. For top and bottom, 0 means the top edge of the element and 1 means the bottom.

{ top: 0.25, left: 0.25, bottom: 0.75, right: 0.75 } would result in a quarter of the element being allowed to hang over the restriction edges.


The endOnly option is used to restrict just before the end of a drag or resize. Before the end event is fired, an extra <action>move event is restricted and fired.

If inertia is enabled and endOnly is set to true then the pointer will follow a curve to the restricted coordinates.
